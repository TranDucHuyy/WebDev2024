                            <p class="movie-list-item-desc">With the help of producer Masaya Kaburagi, Aquamarine "Aqua" Hoshino and Kana Arima have landed the roles of Touki and Tsurugi in Lala Lai Theatrical Company's stage adaptation of the popular manga series Tokyo Blade. Co-starring with them is Aqua's girlfriend, Akane Kurokawa, who plays Touki's fiancée, Princess Saya. Due to the fanbase preferring Tsurugi as Touki's love interest, Saya has made fewer and fewer appearances in the manga, making it difficult for Akane to fully immerse herself in the role. Her struggles are compounded by differences between the play's script and the original work—differences that also frustrate Tokyo Blade's author, Abiko Samejima.

                                Aqua, however, is more concerned with his personal goals than he is with the play. He has only one objective in mind: to grow closer to director Toshirou Kindaichi and find out what he knows about Aqua's mother, Ai.</p>

                            <p class="movie-list-item-desc">Seirei Academy is a prestigious school attended by the very best students in Japan. Alisa Mikhailovna "Alya" Kujou, the half-Russian and half-Japanese treasurer of the school's student council, is known for her intelligence, stunning looks, and rigid personality. Contrasting her near-flawless persona, Alya's unmotivated classmate Masachika Kuze slacks off during lessons and seems to show no interest in her.

                                Initially irritated, Alya gradually becomes more intrigued by Masachika and starts expressing her affection for him in Russian. However, she is oblivious to his secret—he understands the language fluently! Due to a childhood friend who was temporarily staying in Japan, Masachika has been studying Russian in hopes of reuniting with her.
                                
                                As the two spend more time together, the playful and eccentric relationship between them quickly deepens. In the meantime, both must learn to navigate their new growing feelings for one another.</p>

                                Wangnan is determined to reach the top and become the king of the Tower. However, he is weak and has repeatedly failed the exam, with debt collectors tailing him. In desperation, he attempts the exam one more time, only to encounter a mysterious and powerful individual: Jyu Viole Grace, a member of the crime syndicate FUG.
                                
                                Cursing his rotten luck, Wangnan has no choice but to form alliances with strong people, including Viole—who still refuses to be part of any team. Amid a dire situation, Wangnan must find a way to change Viole's mind to finally advance past the 20th floor, or he will never get a chance to build his legacy.</p>

With her peerless beauty, top-notch grades, and position as student council president, her popularity in school is unrivaled. However, she harbors a dark secret—she was a delinquent back in middle school—and this is something she conceals to the best of her abilities.

                                Unfortunately, when she meets the mysterious deer girl Noko Shikanoko, Torako's hidden shame is constantly on the precipice of being exposed due to Shikanoko's rather weird antics. To maintain the reputation she worked so hard for, Torako must go along with Shikanoko's whims, even going so far as to become president of the newly established Deer Club. All her efforts will be rewarded if she can prevent the menacing doe from accidentally blurting out damaging details about her personal history that will undoubtedly unleash Torako's greatest nightmare.</p>

Unfortunately for him, skills of this nature are considered useless due to their low success rate, and Touka is thus assigned the title of E-rank hero. Things take a further turn for the worse when Vicius, the goddess who summoned the class, reveals that the lowest-ranked hero will be disposed of so that they do not hinder those with greater talent.

In a desperate attempt to survive, he uses his supposedly worthless skill—only to quickly realize that it works almost every time. Armed with the ability to render the monsters standing in his way completely helpless, Touka resolves to track down the goddess that tossed him aside and exact his revenge.</p>

In order to finally defeat the Demon leader once and for all, the clan devises a training camp for the Demon Slayer Corps, one led by the remaining Hashira—the most elite warriors in the organization. Each Hashira forms a specialized exercise that will hone both their own abilities and the skills of the ordinary soldiers.

While his half-Demon sister Nezuko is studied by researchers like Shinobu Kochou, Tanjirou embarks to train with the Hashira, seeking mastery in each of their assigned areas of expertise to be best prepared for the coming war—skills vital to Tanjirou, as he has vowed to be the very warrior who will eliminate Muzan for good.</p>

Decades later, the 32-year-old Kafka has all but given up on his dreams of heroism. Instead, he cleans up the remains of the slaughtered kaijuu after they are defeated by valiant soldiers—including Mina, who has successfully achieved their shared goal.

                                Upon meeting his new coworker, Reno Ichikawa, Kafka faces a mirror of his past self: an ambitious young man whose one desire is to fight as a member of the Defense Force. Unfortunately, the two are soon involved in a freak encounter with a rogue kaijuu. Though Kafka demonstrates his innate heroic nature and rescues Reno from certain doom, he is left gravely injured.
                                
                                While both men recover in a hospital, Kafka is seemingly attacked by another one of the beasts. As a result, he gains the ability to transform into a humanoid kaijuu with the strength and powers of the massive monsters menacing Japan. Dubbed "Kaijuu No. 8" by the military, Kafka resolves to use his newfound gifts for the greater good. Tied together by mutual respect, Kafka and Reno set out to join warriors like Mina at the forefront of the Defense Force.

With Diablo's aid, the war with the Falmuth Kingdom ends decisively in Rimuru's favor. Fueled by increased migration and the integration of Jura Forest, the nation of Tempest undergoes rapid growth.

                                Rimuru's victory shifts the balance of power, giving rise to a renewed period of peace—but whether that peace will last is another matter. Yuuki Kagurazaka and Kazalim are conspiring with the Harlequin Alliance to bring about Rimuru's downfall. Furthermore, the Western Holy Church continues its intolerant crusade against Rimuru and his non-human subordinates. Both allies and enemies engage in a battle of wits, carefully advancing their agendas without shattering the delicate status quo. But once the first domino inevitably falls, the race to supremacy begins.</p>

                            <p class="movie-list-item-desc">Following an all-out battle with the Paranormal Liberation Front, it is difficult for the people of Japan to continue placing faith in their heroes. To combat the combined power of Tomura Shigaraki and All For One, All Might calls for his ally from the West—the strongest woman on the planet, Star and Stripe.

                                However, All For One decides to intercept Star and her fleet to get his hands on her overpowered quirk before she can enter Japanese airspace. Although Endeavor, Hawks, and Best Jeanist are headed to the rendezvous point, Star makes a gamble in the present to save her comrades.</p>

                            <p class="movie-list-item-desc">From an early age, Haruka Sakura was made an outcast due to his unconventional appearance and lack of social skills. However, the rough treatment turned him into a proficient fighter, which is now the only thing he prides himself on. Starting at Furin High School, where it is rumored that strength is valued over academics, Sakura has only one goal—taking the top spot.

                                Involved in a street brawl the day before his enrollment, Sakura happens to meet a group of his future schoolmates. Instead of the usual rejection, they fight alongside him, demonstrating that what the school actually cares about is protecting the town of Makochi from any harm—hence why the students call themselves "Bofurin." Surprised by the support and appreciation of the townspeople, Sakura has a hard time accepting their goodwill.
                                
                                Though unfamiliar with kindness being shown to him, Sakura must learn to push past his discomfort when Bofurin is pitted against formidable enemies. After experiencing the feeling of acceptance, he finds himself fighting for the sake of others for the first time.

                            <p class="movie-list-item-desc">With a cartload of fur pelts in tow, traveling merchant Kraft Lawrence stops by the village of Pasloe. According to local folklore, centuries ago, one of the villagers made a promise with the wolf deity Holo, who swore to bless Pasloe with bountiful harvests of wheat. Yet, as time passed, such stories became little more than relics of the past.

                                After quickly finishing his business in the village, Lawrence sets out to his next destination. His journey, however, takes an unexpected turn when he discovers a nude, animal-eared girl sleeping among his pelts. Even more surprisingly, the youthful-looking woman claims to be Holo—the wolf of legend.
                                
                                Holo wishes to return to her hometown in the north, and though their first encounter is rocky, she convinces Lawrence to accompany her on her travels. In return, she vows to earn her keep, using her quick wits and lifetime of experience to help her newfound companion in his dealings. As they continue their journey, Lawrence and Holo take advantage of whatever economic opportunities they come across, often landing in situations that put both their business skills and their relationship to the test.</p>

                            <p class="movie-list-item-desc">In his past life, Prince Lloyd de Saloum was a commoner who could not become adept at magic, no matter how knowledgeable or obsessed he was about it. Now reincarnated into his current royal lineage, he receives a body with seemingly endless mana, making his desire to master all things arcane attainable. Moreover, as the seventh prince of the kingdom, Lloyd has no claim to the throne, allowing him to nurture his abilities as freely as he wants.

                                Unfortunately for Lloyd, ancient seals that imprison powerful demons begin to break down and release the horrors within, endangering the peace. With these monstrosities roaming around, Lloyd's overwhelming magical prowess is the ultimate weapon that can neutralize these threats before all things descend to chaos.</p>

                            <p class="movie-list-item-desc">The Magical Kingdom of Klyrode summons hundreds of heroes from other worlds every year to fight in their war against the Dark One and his army of powerful demons. Banaza is one of those heroes, summoned from the Royal Capital Paluma, but something's not right—Banaza is only an average merchant. He has no magic, no fighting ability, and his stats are abysmal. Worse, a mishap leaves him unable to return home! Rejected as a hero and stranded in another world, abandoned to the far reaches of the kingdom by a cruel king who just wants him gone, Banaza's fate looks pretty bleak. But what will happen once the failed hero candidate finds himself with super cheat powers once he hits level two?</p>
